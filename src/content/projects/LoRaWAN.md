Under the title "Investigation, Planning and Implementation of LoRaWAN for IIoT Applications", I conducted extensive research into this technology. It's written in german language.

The main challenges of this work included setting up the LoRaWAN network server, processing data in the cloud, and achieving reliable long-range transmission in isolated environments.

The thesis explores:

- LoRaWAN network architecture and protocols
- Industrial IoT use cases and requirements
- Cloud-based data processing solutions
- Real-world implementation challenges and solutions
- Performance analysis and optimization techniques

The complete thesis is available for download. I'll might also share insights and findings through blog posts.
